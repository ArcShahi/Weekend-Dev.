I was talking to few people who program , and they are good at it but one thing that bothered me is that some of them have not dealt with Pointers and they don't have any use of it.  

But if you're lucky enough to know pointers that's very good cuz...  Pointers are very important , if your Language doesn't let you use them it doesn't mean they don't have it, they just hide it from you ( cuz you've skill issue ).


Now let's see some code snippets which might seem weird but totally makes sense. After knowing these you can flex to your friends.


We've all used arrays 
```c
int arr[5]={6,9,4,2,0};
```

and when we wanna access an element we do this :

```c
arr[1];
```

but in `C style arrays` you can do this :
```c
1[arr]; // compiles just fine 
```

wait what ?!   how does that make sense ?

Let's see , we may already know that operators are functions too... so the `[]` is also a function  which just makes writing this easy

```cpp
 *(arr+1); // same as arr[1]
```

but in this case the order of addition doesn't matter so we can also write this as 
```cpp
*(1+arr); 

// that's what's happening here
1[arr]; 
```

this is just pointer arithmetic, which is one of the common reasons for bugs ...
So don't write code like that , if you know C++ , you should always prefer :`std::array<T,size_t>` or `std::vector<T>` . 


## Passing Arrays to Functions

People who know `C` and People who "think" they know `C++` will pass arrays to function like this :

```c
void printArr(int arr[],int size);
```

but we can just pass the  array using just a pointer like this :

```cpp

void printArray(int* arr, int size)
{
	for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++)
	{
		std::cout << *(arr + i)<<' ';
	}
}

```

Prints Array just fine, you might be wondering why ?

When you call a function like this :

```c
void printArr(int arr[],int size);
```

```c
int main()
{
   int arr[5] = { 6,9,4,2,0 };
   printArr(arr,5);
}
```

Many People think that entire array is passed to the function  but that's  not the case , According to the **Decay Rule** , only `arr[0]` is passed to the function and inside the hood  it's just: 

`*(arr+0)` or `*arr` ; it's just pointer Arithmetic once again( avoid it)

that's why the function `void printArray(int* arr,int size);` works fine.

Now thank the `[]` subscript operator for making your life easy. Do it... Do it now God Dammit.

But once again don't write code like that, just use the `[]` operator so people can understand what we're trying to do.



## Integers as arrays

Read that again....  It's not array of integers  , it's using integers as arrays.

Well not exactly , In C and C++ we can access individual bytes of `integers` which are 4 Bytes.

Let's see: 
C++
```cpp
// include <cstdint>

int num = 69;
int* ptr = &num;

// Cast the integer pointer to an 8-bit unsigned pointer
uint8_t* byte_ptr = reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(ptr);

for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(int); ++i) 
{

	std::cout << "Byte " << i + 1 << ": " <<
		static_cast<int>(byte_ptr[i]) << ' ';
}
```


or in C
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main()
{
	int num = 69;
	int* ptr = &num;

	// Cast the integer pointer to an 8-bit unsigned pointer
	uint8_t* byte_ptr = (uint8_t*)ptr;


	for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(int); ++i)
	{
		printf("Byte %zu: %d ", i, byte_ptr[i]);
	}


}
```

Let's unpack what's going on, 
We can't directly access the Individual bytes of `int`

1. We store the address to our integer `num` in pointer
2. We tell the compiler to assume the the Address is just 4  contiguous memory `arr[uint_8]` or 8 Bit values , the compiler does that. This doesnâ€™t change the memory itself, but changes how the compiler interprets the data when you access it.
3. We now print Individual bytes of the `int`

That's one of the reason I love C and C++ that control you get is just Absurd. But with great power comes great crashes , segmentation faults and Access violations... so watch out.

If we print it we can see :

Which is what's exactly inside the memory :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab0ae997-f7fa-442f-b2b4-d79af1218df0)

45 is just Hex value of 69

Well if you didn't know already : `char` is just a 8 Bit of memory.  Every thing is just integers... how it's interpreted keeps changing.

That's a lot of new info... but please for God's sake don't even try to write those in Codebases.

Now that's all for this weekend. I'm now going I've to do something illegal:
```asm
mov rip,69
```

Don't worry that won't assemble ;)
