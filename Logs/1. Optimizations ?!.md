# Let's talk about Optimizations...

----


Recently I was solving some problems on Leetcode to keep my neurons firing. I saw some solution which impressed me at first sight ( love at first sight kinda thing ). But I wanted to see what's really happening.... take a look at this.


```cpp
bool isOdd = n & 1;
bool isEven = !(n & 1);
```

It checks  if a number is even or odd
First let's see how that works ( if you know skip ahead ).

you might know the Working of AND Truth table .

```
1 0 -> 0
0 1 -> 0
0 0 -> 0
1 1 -> 1

```


Any number whose least significant bit is 1 that number is **Odd** else it's **even** alright. 

```
5 - 0101 
       ^ 1 So it's Odd ( 1 AND 1 is TRUE )

4 - 0100 
       ^ 0 so it's even ( 0 AND 1 is FALSE )
```

Pretty clever right... ? Well If you ask the people why this is more efficient than using modules operator `%`  ( `n%2==0` ) ,

They will say something like  " Bruh... we're using AND ( & ) operator which is more efficient than using `%` operator duh.."

Well they are correct , but  we DON'T need to do this. The Modern compilers are very smart they know how to optimize stuff and they will OPTIMIZE your version of `even , odd ` functions...

Let's compare both in Godbolt Compiler explorer :

```cpp
bool isEven(int n) { return n & 1; }

bool even(int n) { return n % 2; }

  
int main()

{
    std::cout<<isEven(1349743979);
    std::cout<<even(1349743979);

}
```

## DisAssembly

Let's look at some Assembly...
And  We see those function will be eventually be re-written as 

```asm
isEven(int) :
	mov     eax, edi
	and eax, 1; performing BITWISE AND
	ret

even(int) :
	mov     eax, edi
	and eax, 1 ; exactly the Same
	ret
```


Let's break down what's happening :
1. The arguments which were passed to the function are stored in `edi` register ( depends on OS calling convention )
2.  The value is then copied to `eax` register 
3. The we perform BITWISE AND on value with 1. 

They are literally the same thing.
So we can see that it will be optimized by the compiler.  And I was using `gcc` with `01` Flag.



## What's the Point ?

So Never use it ? Well you are if you're working with a compiler with `-O0` level optimization. Other than that I don't see any reasons to write code like this. Just use the version you're used to . Does this mean the people who use this don't know about Optimizations ? Well most of them  know ... And they just  wanna show off.

And If you do this... what are you doing ?? STOP IT , Get Some Help.. 


## But I wanna show off too ...


Well Let me give you neat trick to show off  


Tell your friends to write a program to swap 2 numbers.  Chances are they'll use a `temp` variable to do this.

We can do that without the need of a third wheel variables..

```cpp
// C++ 20

void swap( auto& x, auto& y)
{

    x = x ^ y;
    y = x ^ y;
    x = x ^ y;
}
```

### wait... what  ?

Lemme explain : let's say we wanted to swap 

`a=9 b=6` , let's pass them into this function.

```cpp
x = 9 ^ 6 ; // 15 
y = 15 ^ 6; // 9
x = 15 ^ 9; // 6

// After Swap 6 9 Noice...
// Make a TRUTH TABLE for Binary Values to See it in depth
```

But let's don't get cocky...  In Most language ( as far as I'm aware ) they use this approach and the above approach work only for `Integers`  only -_- 

So instead of writing this in every code base .. we're better of just using  the standard library for easy to use and to work with multiple types
In C++ , `std::swap`

Or we can use  ` a,b = b,a` in Python.



That's all for this week. Now I'm gonna go I've to seed some torrents ;)
